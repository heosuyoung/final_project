# AI Financial Advisor Debugging Guide

## Changes Made

1. **Frontend Improvements**:
   - Fixed API request handling to avoid infinite retry loops
   - Improved error handling for better debugging
   - Added extensive logging to track chat state
   - Enhanced object serialization for API requests
   - Fixed financial data processing
   - Extended API timeouts to accommodate longer response times

2. **Backend Improvements**:
   - Fixed indentation issues in the API handler
   - Added more detailed error logging
   - Included error details in API responses for debugging

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test the CORS Configuration

First, make sure both your frontend and backend servers are running, then:

```bash
cd c:\Users\SSAFY\Desktop\final_project\back_end
python test_cors.py
```

This will check if your CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration is properly set up.

### 2. Run the Application with Browser Console Open

1. Start your backend server:
```bash
cd c:\Users\SSAFY\Desktop\final_project\back_end
python manage.py runserver
```

2. Start your frontend development server:
```bash
cd c:\Users\SSAFY\Desktop\final_project\front_end
npm run dev
```

3. Open your web application in Chrome or Firefox
4. Open the browser developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect)
5. Go to the Console tab to watch for errors
6. Try using the AI financial advisor chat feature

### 3. What to Look For

When testing the application, pay attention to:

- Console errors during API calls
- Network requests in the Developer Tools Network tab 
- Python server logs for any backend errors

### 4. Common Issues and Solutions

1. **CORS Issues**: If you see errors about CORS in the console:
   - Make sure your Django settings include proper CORS configuration
   - Check that the `django-cors-headers` package is installed

2. **API Key Issues**: If responses are not coming from OpenAI:
   - Verify that the API key in `views.py` is valid
   - Check if the OpenAI API service is operational

3. **Timeout Issues**: If requests take too long and time out:
   - The timeout has been increased to 60 seconds
   - Check server logs for API response times

4. **Financial Data Not Being Processed**:
   - Check the structure of the financial data in the console logs
   - Verify it matches the expected format in the backend

## Further Debugging

If issues persist after these changes, consider:

1. Using a REST client like Postman to test API endpoints directly
2. Enabling more verbose logging in Django 
3. Checking the browser's Network tab for the exact request/response data
4. Adding additional logging statements to narrow down where the failure occurs
